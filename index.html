<!-- Notes Git, Github and Version Control 
Git allows you to roll back to the last save point in case you make unintended changes

You can roll back to any save point you like 

ls -a : shows all the hidden files 

You can use the "git status" command to see what's inside your staging area

you might get untracked files shown in red

git add: adds files to the staging area 

files in green are ready to be committed 

When making a "git commit -m "message" " make sure the message is explicit and in present tense

After a commit you will get the auther and date of the commit 
and before that you get a hash (a hash uniquely identifies this particlular commit)

the dot in git add . specifies everything in the current directory so you don't have to add all the files manually 

git log: shows all your previous commits along with their hashes 

The "Working Directory" is the folder or the directory where you initialize your Git repository 

git add pushes our files to the "Staging Area"

git commit pushes those files to the "Local Repository" 

This is done so that if we mess up a file we can get back the last verison using 
a special command called "git checkout" (to revert back to the position in our local repository)

git diff (+ filename): shows the changes that were made to a file and what was the last save point in our Git repository
The red was the last save and the green was the current changes

to revert back and get rid of unwanted changes to a file we use:
git checkout (+ filename)

// GitHub and Remote Repositories 

git remote add origin (+ url of remote repository on GitHub)
origin is the name of your remote and you should keep it named that way so 
other developers can easily understand what is going on. 

git push -u origin master 
this pushes your local repository to the remote repository using the u flag 
or the u option which links up your remote and your local repositories. And then
we're going to push it to the remote called "origin" and the branch called "master"

The timeline that shows your various commits is called your "master branch"
It is the branch of your main branch of commits or save points and it is squential
This is where your main progress is saved or committed 

You can have a remote repository completely in parallel with your local repository
You can sync them if you wish 

The local repository is the git file that we've got inside our story directory 

The remote repository is the git directory that we've got inside our story directory and
the remote repository is GitHub which hosts our code and also host all of the changes (from git push)

//Gitignore 
 .gitignore is where you would add files that should be ignored when we commit our project to Git

 If you added files and want to not commit them the way they are and remove them from the staging area
 you can use: git rm --cached - r (+ either filenames or . for everything in the current directory)

 To add a fiel to .gitignore add the filename 
 You can use the # to comment 
 You can use wildcards like * (which means all files names that have that extension will be ignored like e.g. *.txt)

 //Cloning 

 git clone: is a way for you to pull down all of the commits and all of the versions of a particular remote 
 repository and store the files inside your working directory 
 
 to use git clone: git clone (+ the url of the respository in GitHub)

 Also you can use git log to see the author's commits
